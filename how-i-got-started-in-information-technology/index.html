                <p>Every once in a while someone asks me how I got started in working in
the information technology realm. Usually someone that is not in the
industry or they are interested in working with computers as a career
and are not really sure where to start. I do not think I have been able
to come up with a great answer but here is how it has worked for me thus&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>I have always had a mechanical inclination. I was one of those kids that
would rather take apart their toys (read break) then play with them. I
originally had a love affair with cars, especially engines. I would have
one of my parent’s take me to the junk yard (before I could drive) just
so I could pull old V8’s and bring them home to disassemble them. This
was entertaining but then our family got a new computer. I had worked
with friend’s computers but was careful not to break them as I knew
their cost. You can imagine my dad’s face when he brought home our first
computer and shortly thereafter I had the internals of it laid out
across the floor. Lucky for me I somehow was able to put it back
together and it still worked. I was hooked as there seemed like an
endless amount of possibilities to keep me&nbsp;occupied.</p>
<p>I continued on my quest of learning more by installing other operating
systems such as Redhat 6 besides the Windows 95 install as a dual boot
installation. Not a very interesting feat now but at the time it was
amazing for me. Fast forward a few years and I had gotten various jobs
working for firms setting up and maintaining computer systems. I
eventually got bit but the security bug while working at a university. I
find the aspect of securing computer systems quite interesting as not
only are you concerned with how information systems are implemented but
also what vectors may be used to attack them and so much more. Enough
about that here’s what I told the last person that was interested in
getting into the technology scene. Opinions vary greatly&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>It depends upon what you see yourself doing in 10, 20 years from now.
Computer Science (<span class="caps">CS</span>) degrees are great and they usually cover the
spectrum when it comes to the world of computing. I was going to get a
<span class="caps">CS</span> degree but was undecided the first two years and by the time I pulled
it together I realized I would need two years of Calculus and Physics
before most universities would even consider me for their programs. I
instead went the Computer Information Science (<span class="caps">CIS</span>) route. This worked
well for me as they are well recognized and the prerequisites were less
demanding and time&nbsp;consuming.</p>
<p>Many universities now offer a number of programs such as Decision
Information Science (<span class="caps">DIS</span>), this example focuses on more of the business
perspective. I know one person whom has gone this route but they have
done well. Most jobs will say they want a technology oriented degree
though are not always specific. Regardless do your research. This
ultimately depends upon what you expect to do and where you want to
work. If you know the type of position you might see yourself in then
look a position descriptions and figure out what the firms desire in
that field. There are plenty of jobs out there but just more competition
for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Due to competition in the market I would definitely recommend three
things. One, if feasible, regardless of the bachelors program get a
masters, these seems to open more doors and some schools have 3/2
programs that allow you to pretty much get a masters and bachelors at
almost the same time. Two, get an internship and/or job working with
computers, helpdesk at a university or work for a small company
maintaining their network, etc. Besides education, experience is highly
regarded in the industry regardless of your concentration and this will
help you figure out what you want to do career wise. Three, look into
certifications such as a <span class="caps">CCNA</span>, Security+, <span class="caps">MCSA</span>. Even entry level
certifications may help get you in the door though this is debatable by&nbsp;some.</p>
<p>I will state that I know people that rely purely upon their experience
and others that are more academically focused. I do not think there is a
sure fire method but for me a combination of both has worked fairly&nbsp;well.</p>
